## 🏃 Quick Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    
    "github.com/piotrlaczkowski/GoLangGraph/pkg/builder"
    "github.com/piotrlaczkowski/GoLangGraph/pkg/llm"
)

func main() {
    // 🤖 Create a simple chat agent
    agent := builder.OneLineChat("MyAgent")
    
    // 🌐 Configure with OpenAI
    provider, err := llm.NewOpenAIProvider(llm.OpenAIConfig{
        APIKey: "your-api-key",
        Model:  "gpt-4",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    agent.SetLLMProvider(provider)
    
    // 🚀 Execute the agent
    ctx := context.Background()
    response, err := agent.Execute(ctx, "Hello, world! 👋")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("🤖 Agent Response: %s\n", response.Content)
}
```
