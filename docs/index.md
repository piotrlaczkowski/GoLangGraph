## 🎯 What is GoLangGraph?

**GoLangGraph** is a Go framework for building AI agent workflows with graph-based execution. It provides a clean, type-safe API for creating intelligent agents that can reason, use tools, and execute complex workflows.

> 💡 **Perfect for**: Building AI applications with local LLMs like Ollama, creating RAG systems, and developing intelligent automation tools.

## ✨ Key Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

## 🏃 Quick Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    
    "github.com/piotrlaczkowski/GoLangGraph/pkg/agent"
    "github.com/piotrlaczkowski/GoLangGraph/pkg/llm"
    "github.com/piotrlaczkowski/GoLangGraph/pkg/tools"
)

func main() {
    // Create LLM provider manager
    llmManager := llm.NewProviderManager()
    
    // Add Ollama provider
    provider, err := llm.NewOllamaProvider(&llm.ProviderConfig{
        Endpoint: "http://localhost:11434",
        Model:    "gemma3:1b",
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    llmManager.RegisterProvider("ollama", provider)
    
    // Create tool registry
    toolRegistry := tools.NewToolRegistry()
    
    // Create agent
    config := &agent.AgentConfig{
        Name:         "chat-agent",
        Type:         agent.AgentTypeChat,
        Model:        "gemma3:1b",
        Provider:     "ollama",
        SystemPrompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
        Temperature:  0.7,
    }
    
    chatAgent := agent.NewAgent(config, llmManager, toolRegistry)
    
    // Execute
    ctx := context.Background()
    execution, err := chatAgent.Execute(ctx, "Hello! Tell me about Go programming.")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("🤖 Agent: %s\n", execution.Output)
}
```
